Type and Shoot
--------------

C++ and SFML 2.0.

In game folder is built version. Requirements: some libraries from VS2013 I guess.

Type enemy name to shoot him. That's all. It doesn't target closest enemy, it depends on create time. Still has some minor memory issues, nothing really important (unless you play for 10hrs straight, lol).

I do not own rights to any of sound files. 
Use graphics as you like:)
